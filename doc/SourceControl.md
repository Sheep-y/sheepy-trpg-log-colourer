# Branches #

`master` is the [release branch](http://code.google.com/p/sheepy-trpg-log-colourer/source/list).  Each commit represents a release to the public.

`development` is the [development branch](http://code.google.com/p/sheepy-trpg-log-colourer/source/list?name=development).  Each commit represents a relatively non-trivial step in development.  New feature is not expected to be complete but the program as a whole should work most of the time.

Local branch should be used for finer changes.

# Tags #

Tags are used to represents public release in master branch and nothing else.
